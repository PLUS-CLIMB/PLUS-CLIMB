## ðŸ§¾ What Does "Observation" Mean?

An **observation** is **one data point** in their dataset, typically for:

* **One country**
* **One time interval (5 years)**
* **One area type (city, rural, town)**

For example:

* The rate of natural change in rural **India** from **1980â€“1985** = **1 observation**

---

The number of **country-level observations** is higher than the number of **city** or **rural** observations in Table 1 because:

### ðŸ”¹ 1. **Data Availability**

* **Country-level data** on the rate of natural change is more **complete** and **readily available** from sources like the UN World Population Prospects (WPP).
* In contrast, **city and rural area-specific data** are much **less frequently reported** in the Demographic Yearbooks (DYB), meaning they exist for **fewer countries and years**.

> For example, the table reports:
>
> * **2,360** country-level observations
> * Only **410** for cities and **408** for rural areas (based on raw DYB data)

This suggests that the **vast majority of countries do not disaggregate** their birth and death rates by urban/rural categories in these public datasets.

### ðŸ”¹ 2. **Every Country-Year Pair Contributes to Country-Level, But Not Always to City/Rural**

* A "country-level observation" is counted for **each country in each five-year interval** for which national data is available.
* But only a **subset** of those intervals will have **subnational (city/rural) data**, so city/rural observations are **fewer**.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. **Imputation Fills Gaps Later, But Not in This Count**

* The **"imputed" values** for cities and rural areas (shown in the lower panel of the table) are **estimates**, not directly observed data.
* Only the **directly collected data** are counted in the top section. So the **raw observation count is lower** for subnational areas.
